 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
 Objective

The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset in order to understand data trends, distributions, and potential outliers using Python data analysis libraries.

 Dataset

Name: Iris Dataset

Source: Built-in dataset from the seaborn library

Description:
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different iris species.

 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – for data loading and inspection

Matplotlib – for basic plotting

Seaborn – for advanced and styled visualizations

 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn and converted it into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Inspection

Checked dataset shape and column names.

Displayed the first few rows using .head().

Used .info() to understand data types and null values.

Used .describe() to generate summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

3. Data Visualization

Scatter Plot: Visualized relationships between features and species.

Histograms: Observed the distribution of numerical features.

Box Plots: Identified spread, median, and potential outliers using the IQR method.

 Key Learnings

Understanding dataset structure is essential before modeling.

Visualizations help uncover patterns and anomalies.

Box plots and histograms are powerful tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

 Conclusion

This task provides a foundational understanding of exploratory data analysis, which is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning workflow.
